# ti-2048

A Titanium Alloy port of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game.

## Supports

* iOS

## Why?

2 reasons:

1. Why not?
2. I was really disappointed with ineraction and performance in the web version on my mobile devices. By levergaing Titanium's cross-platform API I can give the same smooth experience I had on desktop to my mobile devices. Additionally, the transition from web-based game to Titanium will be much easier by using Alloy.
