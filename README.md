# ti-2048

A Titanium Alloy port of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game.

## Why?

2 reasons:

1. Why not?
2. I was really disappointed with ineraction and performance in the web version of 2048 on my mobile devices. By levergaing Titanium's cross-platform API I can give the same smooth experience I had on desktop to my mobile devices. Additionally, the transition from web-based game to Titanium will be much easier by using Alloy.

## Requirements

> _NOTE: The below platforms and versions are what I tested successfully. This will very likely work on many other configurations, but I gaven't tested them directly._

* Titanium [SDK](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/titanium-sdk/) & [CLI](https://www.npmjs.org/package/titanium) 3.2+
* [Alloy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/alloy) 1.3+
* iOS
* Android, Blackberry, and Mobileweb (_coming soon_)
